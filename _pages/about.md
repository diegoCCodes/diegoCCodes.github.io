I am a creative, flexible, proactive and team-oriented person. I have a degree in philosophy
from the University of Valladolid and a technical degree in multiplatform application
development from Ilerna. I did my internship at Entelgy Digital where I was in charge of full
stack web development tasks. Then I worked at Ryme Worldwide developing fullstack
software for vehicle inspection machinery worldwide with C# and .NET for Windows OS.
Currently I am working at Onenak Consulting developing ERP software tools with Infor
technology. In addition, I manage the corresponding relational databases in Microsoft SQL
Server environments that make up a complete environment for managing the resources of
the companies that work with us.
